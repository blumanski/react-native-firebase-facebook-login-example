## react-native-firebase-facebook-login-example
Example on how to implement react-native with firebase/firestack and facebook login

Used components

https://github.com/iodine/react-native-drawer-layout

https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-firestack

https://github.com/magus/react-native-facebook-login

One could clone this repo and get it running by changing a few things around.

But this is just an example on how to implement this.

There are a lot value information in the code which may are confusing in the process of setting all the components up.

If one runs into trouble implementing one of the components, this app was working on ios and android.
